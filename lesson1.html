        The employee performance review is probably one of the most difficult things that you face as a professional. I mean, it doesn't have to be, but it often is. You see, too often people make the choice to think about the review process as a heavy, difficult thing that you just have to survive. We sometimes convince ourselves that it's just an odd checkbox that takes up too many hours, but it is a checkbox we must check in order to feed the system. Again, it doesn't have to be that way. I want you to make a choice right now. Choose to see the review process as an event you control, not something that simply happens to you. You see, when you decide to take control of this process, you realize that, with the right planning, you can make it really work for you. The most important thing you can do by far is to learn how to establish an ongoing dialogue with your supervisor about your performance. Starting several months before the actual review, you're going to put into motion the simple activities that help ensure your evaluation is successful. So let's get started.
